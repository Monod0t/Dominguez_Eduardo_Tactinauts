Difficulties:
 - I wanted to instantiate the tanks with a prefab and then initialize their connections to the controls & such. It proved to be time consuming & wastful for me, so I settled in simply activating the gameObject if they were need for more players.
 - For some reason, the Android SDK Build Tools failed to install, and I had to manually install them with Android Suite. This proved to be very tedious, time consuming, and very annoying.
 - I tested the build on my phone (manually transferring the build instead of using Android Suite since it gave me difficulties), but some tank data such as movement speed and shooting mechanics messed up for some reason.
